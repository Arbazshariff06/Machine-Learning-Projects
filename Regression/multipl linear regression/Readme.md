# 🏡 House Price Prediction using Multiple Linear Regression

This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate a **Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)** model to predict house prices based on various features. Using Python and popular data science libraries, we explore a real-world dataset, preprocess the data, train a regression model, and evaluate its performance.

## 📁 Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to use **multiple linear regression** to estimate the price of a house based on several independent variables such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.  
By understanding the relationships between these features and house prices, we can make data-driven predictions useful for real estate analysis and decision-making.

## 📊 Dataset

- **File:** `housing.csv`  
- **Description:** The dataset contains housing-related features and the corresponding house prices.  
- **Columns:** *(example — adjust based on your dataset)*  
  - `area` — size of the house in square feet  
  - `bedrooms` — number of bedrooms  
  - `bathrooms` — number of bathrooms  
  - `stories` — number of stories  
  - `price` — price of the house *(target variable)*
