🏠 Multiple Linear Regression on Housing Data
📘 Overview

This project uses Multiple Linear Regression to analyze and predict housing data from the housing.csv dataset.
The goal is to understand how different features (like population, total rooms, households, etc.) affect housing attributes.

📂 Files

housing.csv — dataset

multiple_linear_regression.ipynb — Jupyter Notebook with full code

⚙️ Libraries Used

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn

🔧 Steps Involved

Load and explore the dataset

Handle missing values using mean

Encode categorical columns (like ocean_proximity)

Train the model using LinearRegression

Evaluate model performance using:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

📊 Results

The model predicts housing features using multiple input variables.
Evaluation metrics show how well the regression fits the data.
